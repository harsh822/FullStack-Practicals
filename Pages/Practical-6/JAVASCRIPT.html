    <h1>Introduction to JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <img style="width: 80%;" src="./JavaScript.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
        specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
        curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading
        Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web
        server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
        a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
